				Hi! Welcome to my site. 
				I am just starting to teach myself html and css, so this is my first go at it. 
				Taking the time to pursue personal projects like this is a really big passion 
				of mine. While I may be a Computer Science Games major, I don't only spend
				my time in Unity or Unreal Engine, but I pursue a whole host of tech related
				projects! I've also fallen into sprees of SQL, Android development, and Robotics,
				as you may have guessed at from my background. I mainly program in C++, Java, and
				C#. When I am not programming, I am probably doing work as the Social Events Officer
				of USC's branch of the Association for Computing Machinery. That image to the
				bottom right is a group picture of our Executive board. I'm throwing the double "FIGHT ON"
				in the back row. I'm also a member of Virtual Reality Southern California, and I 
				am currently looking into making Unity games for the Google Cardboard. You can find
				more particulars about my work experience and awards from my resume, which is linked
				<br />

				I went to high school at St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, where I was actively involved as captain
				of SPS's US First robotics team, the Metal Vidsters, number 1512. I was in charge of programming the autonomous mode
				for the competition, as well as all of the wiring. In high school, I was very interested in a breadth of tech related
				fiedls, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and game design. It wasn't until applying to colleges that I narrowed
				down to game development, but I still am passionate about robotics, and occaisionally offer advice and assistance to my
				friends still on the team.

			<h6 class = "projtitle">Science on a Sphere</h6>
			<p class="proj"> The Science on a Sphere is a six foot diameter ball that hangs from the ceiling for spherical projections. A computer
			accurately splices image files into four parts and sends the fragments to the four different projectors surrounding the sphere.
			The SOS is capable of showing image files as well as movies, and also has annotation capabilities. In highschool, I learned to 
			make SOS presentations, as well as an Echo Client interface to the server in Java. I wrote several programs to assist teachers
			in showing presentations on the sphere, including a User interface that allowed for automation of shifting through playlists.
			In the final semester of my senior year, I also experimented with using the line annotations on the sphere as part of a graphics
			class that I would eventually attempt to use to make a rudimentary version of Space Invaders. Unfortunately, the framerate dipped
			when adding too many annotations, and the game was unplayable on the Sphere. However, I was able to automate annotations to create
			fractal visualizations.
